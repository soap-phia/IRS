# What can it do?
Uses wifi (Yes, it works!!!) or Ethernet.

* ✅ Connect to wifi
* ✅ Download recovery images
* ✅ Recover with those recovery images, or images put in the device by another device.
* ✅ Boot shims

> [!WARNING]
> Wifi on some grunt boards is broken. One of them is, in fact, barla. Fuck you, barla. If anyone has a solution for this, please open an issue <br>
> <sub> edit: a solution is being worked on, all we need to do is compile the rtw88 kernel modules for the grunt shim kernel :3 - kxtz (eta wen? idk, probably irs 2) <sub>
